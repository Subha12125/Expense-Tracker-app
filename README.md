- **View Expenses**: Display a list of all recorded expenses with their details.
- **Total Expenses Calculation**: Calculate and display the total amount of all recorded expenses.
- **Save and Load Functionality**: Save expenses to a JSON file and load them back for continued tracking.
- **User -Friendly Interface**: Intuitive command-line interface for easy navigation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required.

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expense-tracker.git
   cd expense-tracker
   ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
